# JOJO CHAT

## What is this website?
JoJoChat is a full-stack real-time web chat application. I developed this to help master both frontend and backend integration.
It allows users to communicate instantly via WebSockets, with a clean UI and dynamic message handling.

## Inspiration 
This was obviously Inspired by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and many other shows and games I enjoy watching/playing,
I infused the app with playful references and themed interactions to make it visually engaging and fun. The games were added to give it more
of a vibrant feel and a little more life than a bland chat app, I also wanted to challenge myself with this

## Details
I tried to build this app/website with scalability in mind,
the architecture supports easy expansion for features like user accounts, message persistence, and mini-games. I have documented the code to the best of my ability and want to grow my knowlegde of web development and software development in general with projects like these.

## Main Chat Interface

The chat interface features a clean, minimalist design focused on usability. To enhance engagement beyond basic messaging, I implemented:

  Interactive Sidebar: Access chat, account management, and mini-games seamlessly

  Integrated Economy System: Earn ORA points through the clicker game to unlock cosmetics

  Customization Suite: Equip profile pictures and chat effects purchased through the store
  
  Trigger-Based Effects: Dynamic visual and audio effects that activate when specific phrases are detected in chat

## Information Section

The Info page provides context about the projects purpose and technical foundation:

  Project Rationale: Explains the dual goal of demonstrating full stack capabilities while incorporating personal creative elements

  Technical Transparency: Includes direct link to the GitHub repository for code review and collaboration

  Contact Point: Provides maintainer contact information for bug reports or inquiries

## Store Interface

The store represents one of the project's most polished features, combining aesthetic design with functional mechanics:

  Sleek Card-Based Design: Clean visual presentation with hover effects and nice categorization

  Dual Currency System: Three types of cases (Common, Rare, Legendary) purchasable with ORA points earned through gameplay(clicking)

  Gacha Mechanics: Randomized rewards that create engagement through collection 

  Instant Unlock Feedback: Dynamic notifications that provide satisfying feedback upon purchases

## ORA gameplay

Inspired by incremental games like Cookie Clicker, this feature adds a subtle yet engaging game to play:

  Core Loop Mechanics: Simple clicking combined with upgradeable click power and passive income generation

  Balanced Economy: Exponential cost scaling that encourages strategic decision-making
  
  Visual Feedback: Satisfying animation triggers and real-time counter updates

  Seamless Integration: Earned currency (ORA points) directly fuels the chat customization economy which you are able to then display to others

## Account/Customization Interface

The account section provides users with complete control over their chat experience through:

  Visual Profile Management: Intuitive grid based selection of unlocked profile pictures

  Effect Library: Organized collection of chat triggers and visual effects

  Live Preview: Real time display of currently equipped avatar and active effect

  Collection Progression: Visual tracking of unlocked content that rewards continued engagement


# END
## THANK YOU 
This project represents a passionate effort to make traditional web chat into an engaging experience. Rather than presenting a generic chat application, I tried to show both my technical competency and creative design through personalized gameplay integration and custom features.

This was built with scalability in mind. You would be able to expand on this add many more features and even bigger user baseses. Every component from real time communication to economic systems was crafted to showcase development skills while maintaining user enjoyment and engagement.

I welcome any feedback or questions about the project. Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or opportunities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
