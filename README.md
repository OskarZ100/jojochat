# JOJO CHAT

## What is this website?
JoJoChat is a full-stack real-time web chat application. I developed this to help master both frontend and backend integration.
It allows users to communicate instantly via WebSockets, with a clean UI and dynamic message handling.

## Inspiration 
This was obviously Inspired by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and many other shows and games I enjoy watching/playing,
I infused the app with playful references and themed interactions to make it visually engaging and funâ€”because coding should reflect creativity too.

## Details
I tried to build this app/website with scalability in mind,
the architecture supports easy expansion for features like user accounts, message persistence, and mini-games. The code is modular, well-documented, and ready to grow.
