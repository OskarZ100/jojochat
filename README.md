# JOJO CHAT

## What is this website?
JoJoChat is a full-stack real-time web chat application. I developed this to help master both frontend and backend integration.
It allows users to communicate instantly via WebSockets, with a clean UI and dynamic message handling.

## Inspiration 
This was obviously Inspired by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and many other shows and games I enjoy watching/playing,
I infused the app with playful references and themed interactions to make it visually engaging and fun. The games were added to give it more
of a vibrant feel and a little more life than a bland chat app, I also wanted to challenge myself with this

## Details
I tried to build this app/website with scalability in mind,
the architecture supports easy expansion for features like user accounts, message persistence, and mini-games. I have documented the code to the best of my ability and want to grow my knowlegde of web development and software development in general with projects like these.
